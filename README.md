# Linux-DNS-DHCP-config-network365
My Linux Bind config files (Internet &amp; Intranet) and Linux DHCP config files for Network365.com: set up between 2001 and 2002, this company no longer exists. BIND service was composed of primary and secondary DNS servers. DHCP server was Linux &amp; windows compliant but Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory was the recommended solution for win2k networks.
